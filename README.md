# ** DISCLAIMER **
This API is in constant development. Do not rely on it too much until its in stable release.
All except for the last two APIs ( InboundShipment and OutboundShipment ) are complete.
Help towards completing this last two APIs would be greatly appreciated.
I will mark this as stable 1.0 once all tests have been completed.

# Python Amazon MWS

Python Amazon MWS is a python interface for the Amazon MWS API.
I wrote it to help me upload my products to amazon. However, seeing its potential i decided
to expand it in order for it to cover most ( if not all ) operations in the Amazon MWS.

This is still an ongoing project. If you would like to contribute, see below :).


Its based on the [amazon-mws-python](https://bitbucket.org/richardpenman/amazon-mws-python).

You can read the official Amazon MWS documentation [here](https://developer.amazonservices.com/).
